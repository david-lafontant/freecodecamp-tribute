                        Among microorganisms, life is a constant battle for survival. Alexander Fleming became
                        interested in this. He used to leave bowls with bacteria cultures standing by his worktable. In
                        1928 he saw that in addition to bacteria, a mold fungus had begun to grow in a bowl and that the
                        bacteria's growth had been impeded in the vicinity of the mold. He concluded that the mold
                        contained a substance that was effective against bacteria. The substance was given the name
                        penicillin and became the basis for medication to treat bacterial infections.
